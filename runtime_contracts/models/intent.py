"""VerifiedIntent — the Discovery → Mission boundary.

    Discovery answers "what did the human mean?".
    Mission answers "can I execute exactly that?".

`VerifiedIntent` is the artifact between them, and it is the centre of the
split:

    Everything above creates it.  Everything below consumes it.
    Nothing below may rewrite it.

That third clause is the whole discipline. When an execution engine cannot
honour a field, the answer is a refusal naming the field — never an intent
quietly adjusted until it happens to be executable. An engine that may edit the
intent to suit itself can always produce a figure, and the figure will describe
a plan nobody asked for.

**Why this is a contract and not an application type.** Two runtimes exchange
it, so neither may own it. The failure it prevents is the one where the
consumer's limits leak into the producer's vocabulary: a reader that cannot
*express* "inverse volatility" does not refuse it, it renders it as the nearest
thing it can say. Discovery is therefore free to understand more than any
Mission can execute, and the contract has to be wide enough to carry that.

**Author and producer are different questions.**

    author       who asserted this value          USER · READER · MODEL · POLICY · DEFAULT
    produced_by  which runtime version produced   discovery-runtime@0.4.2
                 the artifact

A user-authored value elicited by ``discovery-runtime@0.4.2`` and the same value
elicited by ``@0.5.0`` are one assertion by one author and two elicitations.
Without the second field, a replay that diverges after an upgrade is
undiagnosable, and a migration cannot find the intents produced by a version
with a known reading bug.

**What participates in identity.** Values, authors, unresolved dimensions and
amendments. Not confidence, not source spans, not evidence, not ``produced_by``
— by the same rule ``EvidenceCandidate`` already applies to retrieval scores:
re-reading changes how confidently a value was reached, it does not change what
was asserted. Two runs that asserted the same values with the same authors are
the same intent, and pinning them apart on a confidence float would make every
model upgrade look like a different request.

**Absent, unresolved and refused are three states.** A dimension nobody asked
about, one the user deliberately left open, and one the user ruled out are
different facts, and a consumer that cannot tell them apart will invent a
default for at least one of them. `unresolved` carries the second explicitly;
the third is a stated value like any other.
